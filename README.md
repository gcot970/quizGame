# Quiz Game

## Description

My motivation was to create a simple game to help me study. I built this project to practice JavaScript and to have something that can be edited with many questions in mind. I learned how to use JavaScript to add or alter elements in the DOM.

## Credits

Most of the psuedocode was written by Ethan Cho.
